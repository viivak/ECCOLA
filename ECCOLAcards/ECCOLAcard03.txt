#3 Communication

Theme: Transparency

Motivation: In practice, communication is a big part of being transparent with your stakeholders. Being transparent in communication can generate trust.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i. What is the goal of the system? Why is this particular system deployed in this specific area? 

ii. What do you communicate about the system to its users and end-users? Is it enough for them to understand how the system works?

iii. If relevant to your system, do you somehow tell your (end-)users that they are interacting with an AI system and not with another human being?

iv. Do you collect user feedback? How is it used to change/improve the system?

v. Are communication and transparency towards other audiences, such as the general public, relevant?

Practical Example: Clearly stating what data you collect and why can make your system more trustworthy. Compare this to a smartphone application that simply states it needs to access your camera and storage.
