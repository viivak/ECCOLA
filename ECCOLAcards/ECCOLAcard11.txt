ECCOLA Card 
#11 Human Oversight

Theme: Agency & Oversight

Motivation: AI systems should support human decision-making. They should not undermine human autonomy by making decisions on behalf of humans. AI systems should be subject to human oversight.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i.Who can control the system and how? In what situations?

ii. What would be the appropriate level of human control for this particular system and its use cases?
 
iii. Related to the Safety and Security cards: how do you detect and respond if something goes wrong? Does the system then stop entirely, partially, or would control be delegated to a human? Why?

Practical Example: Assuming control is especially related to cyber-physical systems such as drones or other vehicles. For purely digital systems, the focus should be on supporting human decision-making instead of directing it.
