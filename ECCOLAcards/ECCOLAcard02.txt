#2 Explainability

Theme: Transparency

Motivation: If we cannot understand the reasons behind the actions of the AI, it is difficult to trust the system.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i. Is explainability a goal for your system? If yes, how do you plan to ensure it?

ii. How well can each decision of the system be understood by both developers and (end-)users?

iii. Did you try to use the simplest and most interpretable model possible for the context? If not, why? 

iv. Did you make trade-offs between explainability and accuracy? What kind of trade-offs and why?

v. How familiar are you with your training or testing data? Can you change it when needed?

vi. If you utilize third party components in the system, how well do you understand them?

Practical Example: When interacting with a robot, users could ideally ask the robot “why did you do that?” and receive an understandable response. This would make it much easier for them to trust the system.
