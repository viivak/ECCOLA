#14 Accessibility

Theme: Fairness

Motivation: Technology can be discriminating in various ways. Given the enormous impact AI systems can have, ensuring equal access to their positive impacts is ethically important.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i. Does the system consider a wide range of individual preferences and abilities? If not, why? 

ii. Is the system usable by those with special needs or disabilities, those at risk of exclusion, or those using assistive technologies? 

iii. Were people representing special interest groups involved in the development of the system?

iv. How are all potential user audiences taken into account? 

v. Is the team involved in building the system representative of your target user audience? Is it representative of the general population?

vi. Did you assess whether there could be (groups of) people who might be disproportionately affected by the negative implications of the system?

Practical Example: AI tends to benefit those who are already technologically capable, resulting in increased inequality.
