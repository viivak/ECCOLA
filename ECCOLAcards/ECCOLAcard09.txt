#9 Access to Data 	

Theme: Data

Motivation: Aside from carefully planning what data you collect and how, it is also important to plan how it can or will be used and by whom.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i. Who can access the users’ data, and under what circumstances? 

ii. How do you ensure that the people who access the data: 1) have a valid reason to do so; and 2) adhere to the regulations and policies related to the data?

iii. Do you keep logs of who accesses the data and when? Do the logs also explain why?

iv. Do you use existing data governance frameworks or protocols? Does your organization have its own?

Practical Example: Third parties you give access to the data can misuse it. A prominent example of this is the case of Cambridge Analytica and Facebook, in which data from Facebook was used questionably. Such incidents can also paint your organization in a bad light even if you were not the ones misusing the data.
