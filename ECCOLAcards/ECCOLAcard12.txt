#12 System Security

Theme: Safety & Security

Motivation: While cybersecurity is important in any system, AI systems present new security challenges. Cyber-physical systems can even cause fatalities in the hands of malicious actors.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i. Did you assess potential forms of attacks to which the system could be vulnerable? Did you consider ones that are unique or more relevant to AI systems?

ii. Did you consider different types of vulnerabilities, such as data pollution and physical infrastructure? 

iii. Have you verified how your system behaves in unexpected situations and environments? 

iv. Does your organization have cybersecurity personnel? Are they involved with the system and on what levels?

Practical Example: The autonomous nature of AI systems enables new vectors of attack. For example, a white line drawn across a road can confuse a self-driving vehicle. The case of Microsoft’s Tay Twitter bot, who began to exhibit extreme views after being bombarded with such, is another example of a new type of attack.
