#6 System Reliability  

Theme: Transparency

Motivation: Transparency makes ethical development possible in the first place. To make it ethical, we must understand how the system works and why it makes certain decisions.

What to Do: Ask yourself:

i. How do you test if the system fulfills its goals?

ii. Have you tested the system comprehensively, including unlikely scenarios? Have the tests been documented?

iii. When the system fails in a certain scenario, will you be able to tell why? Can you replicate the failure?

iv. How do you assure the (end-)user of the system’s reliability?

Practical Example: An autonomous coffee machine successfully brews coffee 8 times out 10. While this is a decent success rate, we are left wondering what happened on the 2 unsuccessful occasions and why. Errors are inevitable. Yet, in order to fix them, we must understand the causes behind them.
