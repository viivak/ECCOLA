#20 Minimizing Negative Impacts 

Theme: Accountability

Motivation: Minimizing negative impacts of the system is financially important for any developer organization. Incidents are often costly.

What to Do:

i. First, consider…
	i. Is your stakeholder analysis up-to-date (Card #0)?
	ii. Have you discussed risks (Card #13)?
	iii. Have you discussed auditability?
	iv. Have you discussed redress issues?

ii. Are the people involved with the development of the system also involved with it during its operational life? If not, they may not feel as accountable.

iii. Are you aware of legal regulations of the system?

iv. Can users of the system somehow report vulnerabilities, risks, and other issues in the system?

v. With whom have you discussed accountability and other ethical issues related to the system, including grey areas?
